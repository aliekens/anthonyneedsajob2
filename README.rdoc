== anthonyneedsajob2

This is a rebuild of anthonyneedsajob, which was in Rails 4 and Ruby 2 (I love these: things) but since the server didn't cope with them, this is a redo of the same project for Rails 3. It is all very elementary, most of the work went into design, which is not obvious from the codebase.
